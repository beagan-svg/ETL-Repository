Achilles	Achilles Cell Line Gene Essentiality Profiles	1	Achilles	Null	The Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network is a cancer phenotyping project that seeks to identify novel cancer drug targets and novel biomarkers for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of drug response.  Libraries of small molecules, cDNA over-expression vectors, and siRNA knockdown vectors are used to perturb molecular signaling pathways in cancer cell lines, and cell fitness is assayed by measuring the rate of cell proliferation.  Achilles is a CTD2 project that performed shRNA-mediated gene knockdown followed by proliferation rate quantification to assess the essentiality of genes for cell proliferation in a panel of cell lines.
